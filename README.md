# Bamazon!

An interactive store where MySQL and NodeJS are used to allow users to purchase items as a customer.

Bamazon allows the user to view the current items available to purchase.  

The user is then prompted to enter the ID # of the item they would like to purchase and how many items they wish to purchase.

If the item is in stock, the order will be completed and the user will see the total for their purchase. If not, they will be notified there are not enough items in stock.
