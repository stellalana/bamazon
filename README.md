# Bamazon!

An interactive store where MySQL and NodeJS are used to allow users to purchase items as a customer. The purpose of this project is to explore how we can use JavaScript and Node to create and manage data systems. The NPM inquirer package was also leveraged in order to ease interaction with the app in CLI.

## Bamazon allows the user to view the current items available to purchase.  
![Store Image](/Images/start.png?raw=true "When file is initialized")


## The user is then prompted to enter the ID # of the item they would like to purchase and how many items they wish to purchase.
![Prompts Image](/Images/prompts.png?raw=true "Prompts")


## If the item is in stock, the order will be completed and the user will see the total for their purchase.
![Prompts Image](/Images/purchase.png?raw=true "Purchase made!")


## If not, they will be notified there are not enough items in stock.
